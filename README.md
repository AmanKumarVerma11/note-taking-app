# It is a minimal note-taking application.

It aims to be a mix between a text-editor and code-editor. It reads and writes `.note` files from your native file system. This means it works well with tools like Dropbox for syncing files across your devices.

Much like a code-editor, Opus opens folders and allows you to edit the files inside. You can have multiple windows open, each with a different folder.

## Features

- **🖋 Editing**: Supports rich text editing with all the features you'd expect.
- **📄 Uses Files**: Uses tangible files in JSON format, not inaccessible databases.
- **🌙 Dark Mode**: Includes a dark mode for late night writing.
- **⚙️ Customizable**: The sidebar and footer can be hidden for a more focused experience.
- **📂 Multiple Projects**: Opus supports opening multiple folders at once.
- **✨ Simple**: Opus has only the features you need.
